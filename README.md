# Quantum Differential Equation Solver
Using a quantum circuits to solve linear differential equations (LDEs) using Qiskit.

Worked is based on the paper: T. Xin et al., “Quantum algorithm for solving linear differential equations: Theory and experiment,” Physical Review A, vol. 101, no. 3, Mar. 2020, doi: 10.1103/physreva.101.032307.
